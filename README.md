## Welcome to the ANU+ Computational Linguistics Reading Group!!

The aim of this reading group is to start to bridge the gap between Linguistics and Computer Science at ANU and to foster a love of the intersection between them.  On the fourth Friday of every month we're going to tackle a paper and in between reading groups, we'll encourage people to play with any of the related code. 

We're going to kick off on Friday Sept 25th from 1 - 2:30pm.

To be included on the Zoom invite, please email kyla.quinn@anu.edu.au or saliha.muradoglu@anu.edu.au
